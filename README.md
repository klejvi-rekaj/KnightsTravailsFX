# 🐴 KnightsTravailsFX

An interactive JavaFX application that simulates a knight’s movement on a chessboard (8x8 grid), calculating the shortest possible path between two points using Breadth-First Search (BFS). The project also allows users to place obstacles and visualizes the knight's path through animations.

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 Shortest path calculation using **BFS**
- ♟️ 8x8 chessboard grid with selectable obstacle tiles
- 🖱️ Input dialogs for setting the knight's start and destination
- 🎞️ Animated knight movement across the board
- 🎨 Custom JavaFX UI with gradient screens and restart option
